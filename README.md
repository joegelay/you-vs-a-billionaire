## About

Since I was a kid, I've been fascinated by billionaires. Not because I wanted to be one necessarily, more so the same way people are fascinated by alien landscapes or weird bugs. How the heck do these things exist in our world?

I've thought a lot about wealth inequality in recenty years after serving as a Peace Corps volunteer in Peru, and coming across William MacAskill's wonderful book [Doing Good Better](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/doing-good-better/). It's a topic that I belive more people should do more thinking about, and my hope is that this project can help spark some awareness, curiosity, and conversations in that direction.

## Inspiration

You Vs. A Billionaire was heavily inspried by Brad Templeton's article - [Bill Gates Wealth Index](https://www.templetons.com/brad/billg.html). Reading Brad's article is one of my earliest internet memories. It has stuck with me since I first discovered it over a dial-up AOL connection.

As mentioned on the site, You Vs. A Billionaire was of course inspired by William MacAskill and the Effective Altruism movement as well.
